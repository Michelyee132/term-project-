            <p>A pair of highly skilled Anime Vanguard Players, with one having more monarchs than the other. I have a friend that have 16 monarchs and his friend only have 5.
                You know, 16 monarchs isn't alot, don't mind that friend with 5, that is a different story *cough *cough totally not the guy with 5 monarchs.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>We started playing Anime Vanguards on its release day, enjoying the game due its insane graphics and a vast majority of anime characters with unique abilities.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The prices in Anime Vanguards are too expensive, so we help players buy products here at an affordable price to improve player experience.
                Mainly to help the players that spent their life saving on the game to get more MONARCH "like my friend Davin" to become the megumi in Anime Vanguard.
                Some people, *cough *cough a certain friend, took MY MONARCHS, why??? What have I done to deserve this?
